# Features:
## Styled character sheets
Character, Creature, and NPC sheets were built to resemble the standard print sheets.


## Draggable & Transferrable Item Cards
Inventory is handled through item cards, which can be moved around freely, moved between sheets, or copied with CTRL+Drag.

Cards are styled to resemble the official game cards, with automated rolls, usage dots, and more being included.


## Automated Skill Rolls
You can roll your stats using the built in advantage/disadvantage system


## Macro Support for Weapons, Items, and Skills
For items, you can simply drag them into the hotbar, or use this script:

```
game.mausritter.rollItemMacro("itemName");
```
For Skills, create a new macro with this
```
game.mausritter.rollStatMacro();
```
